# Cloud Resource Schema
The unified schema to represent cloud resources. It defines the schema in OpenApi format and also generates Java code 
based on the schema. Both OpenApi schema and Java code in this package. You can either use the Java code directly or 
generated your own code from the OpenApi schema.
Currently CRL Janitor only uses this OpenApi yaml file and generates its own Java code.

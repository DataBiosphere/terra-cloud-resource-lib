# Google Api Services Common
This package is for implementing common utilities for [Google's Api Client Library](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java), i.e. `com.google.api.services` packages. All Google public APIs have auto-generated Java API Client Libraries.

Some Google Cloud APIs have manually written libraries, e.g. `com.google.cloud` packages. When those Cloud libraries are available, they should be used by CRL instead of the auto-generated API Client libraries.
